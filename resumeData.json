    "bio":"Right now, I am a stay at home mother. I took a career break to raise my son. I considered a career change when i wanted to come back to the workforce. I worked as a pre-school teacher for few months. That is when I realized how much I miss coding and debugging. I wanted to pursue my developer profession again. I realized the technology field has changed drastically. So I started to self-learn new skills and joined bootcamp to get employer-ready. I am proficient in React, Node server, MySQL, Mongo database and MERN and demonstrate strong logical, analytical, problem solving skills. Eager to combine my background in Computer Science with my technical skills to develop robust and user friendly software.",
